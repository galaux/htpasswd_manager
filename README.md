htpasswd_manager
================

Small PHP app to change passwords from a htpasswd file and use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for style.

Author of this code is [Fulvio DI MARCO](http://fdimarco.wordpress.com). I only modified it to save SHA-512 encrypted passwords. Original blog post about this code is [here](http://fdimarco.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/let-users-manage-their-personal-svn-passwords-based-on-htpasswd-authentication/).
